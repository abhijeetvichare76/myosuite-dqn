This repository consists of developing controllers for a physiologically realistic musculoskeletal hand to solve dexterous manipulation tasks:

- A) **Die reorientation task** reconfiguring the die to match the desired orientation (`myoChallengeDieReorientP1-v0`)

- B) **Baoding ball task** involving simultaneous rotation of two free-floating spheres over the palm. (`myoChallengeBaodingP1-v1`).
